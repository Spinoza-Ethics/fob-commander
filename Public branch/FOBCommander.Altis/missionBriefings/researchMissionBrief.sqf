	"Device traces detected. At 1200, a recon drone picked up high thermal signatures from a sealed lab. Your job: breach, locate, destroy. If HVTs are present, extract. Expect zero mercy from enemy QRFs. Good luck, Reaper-1.",

	"Intel sweep last night flagged anomalous comms. A prototype device is believed hidden underground. Neutralize it before they move it. Rescue VIPs if found. Enemy unit ‘Jackal’ is confirmed in the AO. Stay sharp.",

	"Command’s words: 'Find it, fry it, forget it.' A secret weapon’s under wraps. They want it gone before sundown. HVTs may be present. You? You're the lucky strike team. Watch for minefields. Don’t screw this up.",

	"A power surge at 0300 exposed a hidden research grid. That’s your target. Hit hard, disable the device, extract if possible. VIPs? Optional. Survival? Unlikely. But the skies are clear. Get it done.",

	"At 1430 yesterday, drone AV-7 caught movement near a sealed compound. They're guarding something big. Your mission: breach, find the tech, delete it. Rescue any survivors, but avoid detection at all costs.",

	"This ain't about medals. This is payback. They used it on our boys last week. Same model, same signature. Get in, burn the prototype, and bring our people home if they're still breathing.",

	"Dawn op. Enemy patrols change at 0500. Slip in, search the compound, and destroy whatever tech they’re hiding. If there’s an HVT, bag them too. Minimal resistance expected. That’s probably a lie.",

	"Morale’s tanking. Command wants a win. You’re heading in to recover or wreck a black-site device. If VIPs are there, extract them. Enemy is standard military—no flags, no mercy. Be the nightmare.",

	"Unit 'Falcon-3' went dark during recon. You're going in to finish what they started. Confirm device presence. Destroy it. If the HVT's alive, extract. Expect heavy resistance, especially near bunkers.",

	"Recent satellite pass picked up an odd signal spike. EM bursts at 0920, then silence. Orders are simple: breach site, destroy the core. VIP status unknown. Bring drones if you value your limbs.",

	"R&D went too far. One of ours defected and took half a prototype with him. Track the signal. Destroy the device. Eliminate or rescue the traitor. If they ask questions later, that's not your problem.",

	"A strange fog hangs near the objective—some say it’s natural, others swear it isn't. Navigate carefully. Your target is a lab device. Wipe it. HVTs optional. Reinforcements may arrive by 1300.",

	"They think they’re untouchable in that lab. Let’s prove otherwise. At 1400, assault begins. Find the experimental system and reduce it to ash. Any HVTs found are to be secured or silenced.",

	"Two days ago, a drone captured crates marked 'XG-9'. Only one place they could've gone. Breach the perimeter, identify the tech, and wreck it. Rescue hostages if able. Leave no usable scrap behind.",

	"The last team got spiked—radio chatter ceased mid-sentence. You’re next up. Recover the tech or kill it with thermite. High chance of enemy armor. Use field credits wisely. We won't hold your hand.",

	"Rumors of strange experiments swirl from locals. Civilians fleeing. HQ suspects illegal testing. Confirm device presence. Obliterate. If HVTs scream loud enough, bring them too.",

	"This is a black-bag job. No records, no rescue. You’re ghosts. Enter compound at nightfall, neutralize the prototype. Collateral isn’t a concern. Avoid leaving gear behind—they’ll trace it.",

	"Heavy movement detected at 1100 around the old radio array. Something’s alive in there. Find the device. Smash it. Pull out with any captured personnel. Don’t linger—locals report disappearances.",

	"Your job is to wipe the drive and torch the machine. Intel suggests deep underground lab access. Use explosives. If HVTs are present, extract. If not—no tears. Return by 1600 or not at all.",

	"Bravo-9 said they found 'the core' before we lost them. Sounds like your cue. Infiltrate, locate the energy source, destroy on-site. Check for survivors, but don’t get sentimental. Leave nothing usable.",

	"Enemy convoy moved key tech this morning. It’s likely housed in a fortified hangar now. Hit fast, destroy the device, rescue the defector if possible. Air recon is offline. You’re on your own.",

	"Device is time-sensitive. We estimate detonation or transfer by 1700. You know the drill: find, breach, destroy. If there’s an HVT, bring them. If not, leave only ashes.",

	"Blood was spilled last week—ours. Command tracked the signal back to a cold facility. Breach. Verify. Eliminate the tech. Prisoners? Only if alive. Make it hurt, Echo-2.",

	"At 0600, seismic scans picked up buried structures. Your target lies within. Get in, get dirty, and ruin it. Hostages may be present. Watch for drones—they bite now.",

	"You’ve been selected because you're expendable. Kidding. Mostly. Destroy the unknown device housed deep in the research bunker. Rescue HVTs if breathing. Avoid firefights—you’re outnumbered.",

	"We're not sure what it is, but it pulses every 22 minutes. Could be a signal. Could be worse. Orders: shut it down. Extract survivors if lucky. If you start hearing voices, pull back immediately.",

	"You’ll insert at 0100. Low light, low morale. That compound hides a prototype. You’ll end it. HVTs are likely bait—don’t fall for it. Use XP to get armor if you want to survive long enough to die later.",

	"The tech is alien, or at least not ours. Rumors swirl. HQ wants it gone. Burn it. If anyone's guarding it, show them the same kindness. HVT rescue is a bonus. Mind the storm—starts around 1500.",

	"Three months ago, Operation Cold Slate failed. Now we’ve got a second shot. You’ll enter at noon, bypass patrols, breach the lab, and destroy the remaining device. No mercy. Show them what vengeance looks like.",

	"They called it 'Prometheus.' It’s still active. Your task: Find the device. End the project. If HVTs beg for extraction, fine. If they resist, leave them. Keep drones airborne—interference is likely.",

	"No jokes this time. You’re heading into an abandoned data center believed to house dangerous tech. Erase it. Don’t bring souvenirs. HVTs may be kept for interrogation. Or worse.",

	"You’ve got 6 hours before they move the device to another continent. Hit hard, hit fast. Blow the prototype to hell. Retrieve any surviving intel or personnel. Exfil by helo or run like hell.",

	"Intel says the machine emits pulses every 45 seconds. Unknown effect. HQ is spooked. You’re the solution. Eliminate the source. Rescue efforts permitted. Exposure beyond 10 minutes may be fatal.",

	"Device located in enemy research hangar. Expect full military defense. No reinforcements until 1900. Destroy prototype. Save VIPs if present. Equipment loadout is up to you. May God sort the rest.",

	"Command wants the facility sanitized. Device destroyed. VIPs extracted. You’ll have access to mortars and drones. Use them wisely. Enemy patrols rotate every 10 minutes. Be ghosts, not heroes.",

	"A week ago, our recon team saw a glowing crate moved into a bunker. They never checked in. You will. Neutralize the unknown tech. Find out what happened. Rescue VIPs only if not compromised.",

	"A general defected and took half the prototype with him. We tracked him to a fortified silo. Eliminate the device. Capture or kill the defector. Expect resistance. Expect nothing else.",

	"Device must be destroyed before sunset. HVTs are likely secondary objectives. Make use of drone support and light armor if needed. Enemy sniper teams may be active near outer perimeter.",

	"They’ve started harvesting signals from old satellites. Device is inside a comms station. Breach and wreck it. Enemy forces expected to retaliate fast. In and out, or not at all.",

	"At 0300, whispers of 'the machine' reached Command. Some say it sees into time. You? You’re burning it. No questions asked. HVTs optional. Take nothing. Leave no trace. You weren’t there.",

	"Think of this as pest control. A device was rigged from stolen parts, now active. Locate and destroy. Expect improvised defenses. Rescue HVTs if found—chances are slim. Still worth trying.",

	"A desert compound. No comms in or out for 48 hours. You’re inserting blind. Destroy whatever tech they’ve built. Anyone worth saving gets pulled. Avoid being seen. Avoid being missed.",

	"Today’s target is a mobile command device, currently grounded. That won’t last. Disable it, destroy it, recover personnel if found. Use drones to scout. Expect movement by 1330.",

	"HVT is believed imprisoned near the objective. If found, extract. Main goal: locate and terminate the experimental energy weapon. Air support denied. Rely on field credits to improvise.",

	"This one’s cold. Literally. Snowstorm hits at 1800. You’ll move at 1500. Breach a buried lab, disable device, extract any captives. Dress warm. No second chances.",

	"The last drone captured visuals of strange light coming from a sealed vault. Investigate. Destroy whatever they built. HVTs might be in cryo. Bring body bags, just in case.",

	"Orders are simple: Burn the black lab, crush the device, and recover what’s left of Delta-4. No one gets left behind this time. Reinforcements ETA 2100. Hold until then or disappear.",

	"Data suggests device emits low-frequency harmonics. Rumors suggest mind control. Eliminate it, rescue any surviving command personnel. Maintain comms silence—paranoia spreads fast."
